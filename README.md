# Travel Listing Web App
This is a frontend web application that allows users to add, view, filter, and manage travel destinations. Users can add destinations with images, prices, and descriptions, view all destinations in a clean card layout, and filter destinations by name, price range, and place for easy exploration.
The site uses localStorage to store destination data, ensuring your added destinations remain even after refreshing or reopening the browser.
